## Action Interpretation

1. `keep`: no rename/split needed.
2. `rename_case_name`: rename case to input-scenario wording, keep fixture
   content/expectations.
3. `split_minimal_valid`: extract focused cases from overloaded baseline case.
4. `keep_with_owner_note`: keep case but ensure README states ownership
   boundary.
