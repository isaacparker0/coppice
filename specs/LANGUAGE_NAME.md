# Coppice

## Overview

The language is named **Coppice**.

A _coppice_ is a managed woodland in which trees are periodically cut back to
encourage structured, healthy regrowth. Rather than allowing wild, unbounded
growth, coppicing shapes development deliberately over time. It is an old,
disciplined practice of cultivation.

This metaphor closely aligns with the philosophy and design goals of the
language.

## Philosophical Alignment

Coppice embodies several core principles of the language:

### 1. Managed Growth

The language prioritizes **structured, intentional development** over unchecked
expressiveness. Like a coppiced woodland:

- Excess is cut back.
- Growth is guided.
- The system becomes stronger and more coherent over time.

The compiler enforces canonical forms, rejects ambiguity, and removes stylistic
multiplicity. Code is not allowed to grow wild.

---

### 2. Pruning Over Proliferation

Coppicing is not about decoration — it is about **pruning to promote long-term
structure**.

Similarly, this language:

- Eliminates redundant constructs.
- Rejects overlapping syntax.
- Prefers one canonical way to express intent.
- Treats the compiler as an enforcer of clarity.

Pruning is not restriction — it is cultivation.

### 3. Discipline Without Harshness

The name needed to feel:

- Organic but not whimsical.
- Structured but not authoritarian.
- Light, yet serious.
- Alive, but controlled.

“Coppice” strikes that balance. It is neither cute nor severe. It carries
historical weight without feeling archaic or ornamental.

---

### 4. Long-Term Stewardship

Coppicing is cyclical and sustainable. It implies stewardship and maintenance
over time.

This reflects the language’s emphasis on:

- Deterministic builds.
- Hermetic compilation.
- Enforced formatting.
- Explicit design.
- Long-term codebase clarity.

The goal is not cleverness — it is durability.

## Why Not Something Else?

During naming exploration, many alternatives were considered:

- More whimsical plant names (e.g., light “sprout”-style names) felt too playful
  and were often already used in software.
- Heavier Old English landscape terms felt overly archaic or surname-like.

Coppice provided the best balance of:

- Obscurity without awkwardness.
- Organic metaphor without ornamentation.
- Philosophical depth without pretension.

---

## File Extension

The official file extension is:

```
.copp
```

This choice balances identity and daily ergonomics:

- Keep a clear link to the language name.
- Minimize typing friction in common workflows.
- Avoid overloaded terms and acronym ambiguity.

`.copp` remains recognizably tied to **Coppice** while keeping filenames and
commands compact.

Examples:

```
main.copp
server.bin.copp
token.test.copp
PACKAGE.copp
```

## Final Decision

The name **Coppice** reflects the language’s core ethos:

> Deliberate cultivation. Structured growth. Pruning toward clarity. One
> canonical form.

Code in Coppice is not wild undergrowth. It is shaped woodland.
