# Coppice

Coppice is a (work-in-progress!) language and compiler.

### Goals

- One canonical way to express intent.
- Compiler-integrated tooling.
- Ergonomic, readable syntax with low annotation burden.
- Fast compile times with practical runtime performance.
- Strong safety and correctness with an ergonomic, expressive static type
  system.
- Deterministic compilation with explicit semantics that map cleanly to a build
  system such as Bazel.

### Language name

A
[_coppice_](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/discover/nature/trees-plants/what-is-coppicing)
is a managed woodland in which trees are periodically cut back to encourage
structured, healthy regrowth. Rather than allowing wild, unbounded growth,
coppicing shapes development deliberately over time. It is an old, disciplined
practice of cultivation.

_Coppice_ reflects the language's design philosophy: deliberate structure over
unchecked growth. The compiler enforces canonical forms, rejects ambiguity, and
removes stylistic multiplicity, encouraging clarity, consistency, and
maintainability.
